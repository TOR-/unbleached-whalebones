<h2>Requirement</h2>
<p>Design your own application layer protocol to transfer a file over the Internet 
using TCP, and write both the client program and the server program to implement it.</p>
<p>You may choose whether to transfer a file from client to server or from
server to client.&nbsp; 
A better implementation would allow transfers in either direction.&nbsp; 
Either way, the transfer should be controlled from the client - there should be 
no need for user input at the server.</p>
<p>With a team of four students, two of you should write the client
program and two should write the server program.&nbsp;
Obviously, you should agree on the protocol design before you start.</p>

<h3>Client Details</h3>
<p>The client program should ask the user for the IP address of the server, 
and perhaps the port number.&nbsp;
It should also ask for the name of the file to be transferred,
and perhaps the direction of transfer (upload or download, send or get).</p>
<p>The client should then open a TCP connection to the server.&nbsp; 
See the <a href="https://elearning.ucd.ie/bbcswebdav/pid-1148116-dt-content-rid-6207552_1/courses/EEEN20060/lab/TCP-operation.html">TCP</a> page for details 
of how to do this, or look at the example in <a href="https://elearning.ucd.ie/bbcswebdav/pid-1148116-dt-content-rid-6207552_1/courses/EEEN20060/lab/client.c">client.c</a>.</p>
<p>When the connection is established, the client can
send a command or request to the server.&nbsp; 
This could ask the server to find a specified file and send it back to the client (download), 
or it could ask the server to accept a file that the client is about to send (upload).&nbsp; 
The structure of the request will depend on the protocol that you have designed.</p>
<p>If the server accepts the request, or if your protocol does not allow it to refuse, 
the client must then either accept the file from the server or send the file to the
server, as appropriate.&nbsp; 
It could then allow the user to request another transfer, or it could close 
the connection and stop.</p>

<h3>Server Details</h3>
<p>The server program should listen on port 32980 - the Windows firewall on the 
lab computers has been configured to allow programs to accept connections 
on that port.&nbsp;
If you are testing on your own computer, you can use a different port, but
you will probably have to grant permission for your program to use that port.</p>
<p>See the <a href="https://elearning.ucd.ie/bbcswebdav/pid-1148116-dt-content-rid-6207552_1/courses/EEEN20060/lab/TCP-operation.html">TCP</a> page 
for details of how to set up the server to accept connection requests,
or look at the example in <a href="https://elearning.ucd.ie/bbcswebdav/pid-1148116-dt-content-rid-6207552_1/courses/EEEN20060/lab/server.c">server.c</a>.</p>
<p>When a client connects, the server should do whatever the client requests.&nbsp;
It would be useful to print messages to show what it is doing, but it
should not ask the user for any input.</p>
<p>If the server is asked to send a file (download), it is
possible that the file may not exist.&nbsp; 
The server should return some appropriate response to the client.</p>
<p>If the server is asked to receive a file (upload), it
must store the file somewhere.&nbsp; 
If the client specifies the name of the file, the server should take care that this does not
over-write some important file on its disk.&nbsp; 
(Consider what happens if the client uploads a file called 
<span class="codetext">server.c</span> !)</p>
<p>A crude solution is to store all received files under one fixed name, such as 
<span class="codetext">received.txt</span> or 
<span class="codetext">uploaded.txt</span>.&nbsp;
If the file is not a text file, you will have to rename it afterwards, 
changing the extension to .pdf or .jpg as appropriate.&nbsp;
A more elegant alternative would be to create a separate folder for all uploaded 
files.&nbsp;
Then the received files could be stored in that folder, with their original names.&nbsp;
You could also restrict the client to downloading files from the same folder, 
isolating the rest of the server from any action by the client.</p>

<h3>Protocol Design</h3>
<p>You may assume that the TCP connection provides a reliable transfer of an
indefinite stream of bytes, in the correct order.&nbsp; 
This means that you do not have to worry about errors, checksums, etc. - TCP takes
care of that.</p>
<p>However, if you ask TCP to send a block of bytes, you should not assume that 
those bytes will be delivered in one block at the receiver - blocks may be split or
joined in transit.&nbsp; 
Most networks will deliver a block of up to 1400 bytes without splitting it, 
but this is not guaranteed.</p>
<p>Your protocol should not rely on block boundaries to identify different 
parts of the conversation between client and server.</p>

<p>One of the design questions is who sends first?&nbsp;
In the example programs, the client sends a message, and the server responds.&nbsp;
HTTP also works this way.&nbsp; 
In some other Internet protocols, the server sends the first message, 
prompting the client for a request.&nbsp;
Either method should work...</p>
<p>Some of the data that you transfer will be part of your protocol (header), 
and some will be the content of the file - you need to devise some way to 
distinguish between these.&nbsp; 
A marker byte (or sequence of bytes) at the end of the
header is probably the simplest approach - you need to choose something
that will never occur in the header, but it does not matter if it
occurs in the file content.&nbsp; 
HTTP uses this method, but a simpler implementation is possible.</p>
<p>You also need some way of knowing when the end of the file is reached.&nbsp; 
The simplest option is probably to have the sender (which could be client
or server) close the TCP connection when it reaches the end of the file.&nbsp;
The receiver can detect when the connection is closed, and close the output file.</p>
<p>A better method, used in HTTP, is to send the size of the file as part of the header,
so the receiver knows in advance how many bytes it has to receive.&nbsp; 
This would allow the connection to remain open for another transfer request.</p>
<p>For information on file handling, including a method for finding the size 
of a file, see the page on <a href="https://elearning.ucd.ie/bbcswebdav/pid-1148116-dt-content-rid-6207552_1/courses/EEEN20060/lab/file-handling.html">file handling</a>.&nbsp;
There are examples in the program <a href="https://elearning.ucd.ie/bbcswebdav/pid-1148116-dt-content-rid-6207552_1/courses/EEEN20060/lab/file-demo.c">file-demo.c</a>.</p>

<h4>Request format</h4>
<p>Many Internet protocols, including HTTP, use requests
and responses that are in plain text, with line endings.&nbsp;
This is not particularly efficient, but it is convenient.&nbsp; 
It means that the transactions can be read by a human without any conversion.&nbsp;
It also means that the requests and responses will only
contain a limited range of byte values, so it is easy to choose a
marker byte that will never be used in a request or response.</p>
<p> You may want to include a number, such as the size of a
file, in your request or response.&nbsp; 
To send a number as text, you can convert it to a string of characters, 
then convert the characters back to a numerical value at the receiver.&nbsp; 
For information on handling strings, including methods of converting 
numbers to strings and back again, see the page on 
<a href="https://elearning.ucd.ie/bbcswebdav/pid-1148116-dt-content-rid-6207552_1/courses/EEEN20060/lab/string-conv.html">string handling</a>.&nbsp; 
There are examples in the program <a href="https://elearning.ucd.ie/bbcswebdav/pid-1148116-dt-content-rid-6207552_1/courses/EEEN20060/lab/file-demo.c">file-demo.c</a>.</p>
<p>The alternative is to split the number into its separate
bytes, and send these in sequence through the TCP stream.&nbsp; 
For example, if you have a 32-bit integer, you could split it into 4 bytes.&nbsp;
You would have to decide which byte to send first, so that
the receiver could re-assemble them in the correct order.&nbsp;
These bytes could have any value from 0 to 255, so there
would be no safe marker byte available.</p>
<p>Another option, if you wanted to restrict the range of
values, would be to break the 32-bit integer into 5 groups of 7 bits,
according to an agreed rule.&nbsp; 
These could then be sent as bytes through the TCP stream, but would only occupy half
of the range of possible byte values, leaving the other half available for use as markers.</p>

<h4>Response processing</h4>
<p>If the client requests a file to be sent to it (download), the 
response from the server will probably start with some status information,
accepting or rejecting the request - maybe the file does not exist?&nbsp;
This might be followed by more header information, such as the size of the file.&nbsp;
When all the header information has been sent, there will be a marker of some sort
to indicate the end of the header.&nbsp;
This could be followed by the bytes making up the contents of the file.</p>
<p>There are C functions to help you find a marker in an array of bytes, and to help
break a string into separate pieces of information.&nbsp;
See the page on <a href="https://elearning.ucd.ie/bbcswebdav/pid-1148116-dt-content-rid-6207552_1/courses/EEEN20060/lab/string-conv.html">string handling</a>.&nbsp; 
There are examples in the program <a href="https://elearning.ucd.ie/bbcswebdav/pid-1148116-dt-content-rid-6207552_1/courses/EEEN20060/lab/file-demo.c">file-demo.c</a>.</p>
<p>Similar issues will arise at the server, which has to extract information from
the request that it receives from the client.&nbsp;
In the case of an upload, it might also have to separate some header information 
from the file contents.</p>
