Proposed DRAFT A v0.1: unbleached whale bones
Stateless - no state preserved on server between requests
Persistent - connection persists until terminated by client or server, i.e. when no more files are to be sent.
Control information sent with data in one message.
Control information in 7 bit ASCII.
Protocol consists of one or more requests to a server, followed by one response per request.

Connection stays open from client's connect() until client has no more data to send.
Connection may be terminated by server if no request is received from the client for a time specified by
the server in the Server-timeout header sent with the previous response.


Request:
	One request per file.

	format:
		<command><LF>
		<header><LF>
			⋯
		<header><LF>
		<LF>
		<data>

	<command> - List of commands given in § COMMAND. Terminated by a line-feed character (denoted <LF>).
	<header> - Supplementary information with request. List in § HEADER. Terminated by <LF>.
Response:
	One response per file.

	format:
		<status><LF>
		<header><LF>
			⋯
		<header><LF>
		<LF>
		<data>

	<status> - How the server fared with processing the request.
	<header> - See § Request.
	<data> - the file data as requested. Can contain an error message in the case of an error.
						Data size is specified in the <header>

Transaction Format:
Client connects to server
Server accepts
Client sends request message
Definitions:
COMMAND:

GIFT<SPC><filepath>
    Gift the server with a file located at <filepath>.
WESL<SPC><filepath>
    Weasel a file located at <filepath> from the server.
LIST<SPC><filepath>
    List all files located at <filepath>.

1xx successful transaction
100 Connection successful
101 Command recognised
102 Connection terminated
110 Command successful

2xx informational
200 Command not implemented
201 Server preparing for shutdown

340 File not found

4xx server error
400 Command not implemented
410 Cannot satisfy request

HEADER:
Data-length:<length>
    Length of data portion of message
Data-type:<type of response data>
    Filetype of data portion of message
    Preferably this would be a MIME type
Timeout: <max waiting time>
		Length of time server/client will wait for next response before closing connection
		#Might be something more useful this could be on client side




	For V2
	Header:
Data-encoding:<encoding>
    Encoding of data portion
Date:<%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ>
    ISO 8601 UTC+0 time and date of message sending
Last-modified:<%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ>
    ISO 8601 UTC+0 time and date of last modification to file
    Used to enable caching
    Possibly unnecessary
Preferred-encoding:<encoding>[<COMMA><encoding>...]
    List of encodings the client can handle, in order of preference.

		Request:
Send a query to check if enough space is available
